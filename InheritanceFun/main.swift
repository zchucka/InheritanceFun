import Foundation

// inheritance: an OOP principle where you can define a hierarchical relationship amongst classes
// a base class AKA super class AKA parent class
// a derived classs AKA sub class AKA child class
// a sub class inherits the state and behavior from a super class
// in swift, structs do not support inheritance
// in swift, there is no universal base class
// for example there's no object like there is in Java
// use the keyword super to refer to a member of the super class
// use the keyword override to override behavior or state in a sub class

print("hello world")
